Rmpc can play videos from youtube, soundcloud and nicovideo, but needs a little setup before it
can do that. Only single songs can be added at a time.
For youtube, playlists are supported as well. Be careful though because executing `addyt` for
a playlist will start downloading all contained songs, this action might take some time to finish
and cannot be stopped except by terminating rmpc.

<Steps>

    1. Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and have it available in your PATH.
    2. Install [yt-dlp's dependencies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies): ffmpeg, ffprobe, python3 and python's mutagen library.
    3. Configure rmpc's cache directory <a href={path("configuration/#cache_dir")}>in your config file</a>
    4. Connect to MPD with a local socket and not IP address.
    5. Add music to the queue:
       <ul>
          <li><strong>From a URL:</strong> <code>rmpc addyt &lt;youtube-url&gt;</code> (TUI: <code>addyt &lt;youtube-url&gt;</code>)</li>
          <li><strong>Search by name (first result):</strong> <code>rmpc searchyt "search terms"</code> (TUI: <code>searchyt "search terms"</code>)</li>
          <li><strong>Optional position:</strong> add <code>--position &lt;n|+n|-n&gt;</code> to enqueue at an absolute or relative position</li>
       </ul>

</Steps>

:::caution
MPD will not be able to add songs from outside its music directory if not connected through local socket.
